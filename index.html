      <p>In between all schools in the HoFA (Hall of Famers Asscociation), there is a highly competitive competition called the "International Singing Competition". In that competition, 𝕽𝖆𝖓𝖉𝖔𝖒 𝕾𝖈𝖍𝖔𝖔𝖑™ celeb Panda Bo's group, 𝒫𝒶𝓃𝒹𝒶 𝐵𝑜'𝓈 𝒮𝒾𝓃𝑔𝒾𝓃𝑔 𝒯𝓇𝒾𝑜, won the victory for 𝕽𝖆𝖓𝖉𝖔𝖒 𝕾𝖈𝖍𝖔𝖔𝖑™, making it one of the most respected schools in the HoFA.</p>

    <p>In all of HoFA, 𝕽𝖆𝖓𝖉𝖔𝖒 𝕾𝖈𝖍𝖔𝖔𝖑™ is proud to say they are the largest school within the HoFA. This is thanks to school celeb Panda Bo, for convincing the Assitant Principle to make an extention to the auditorium (there is reason to believe this was done so that there was more room for the weekly carnivals, but nothing is confirmed).</p>
